//! The chain ability seam.
//!
//! [`ChainLayer`] is the single entry point the rest of the crate uses to reach
//! the Bitcoin chain. Each chain *ability* occupies a slot: FEE, BROADCAST,
//! TX_STATUS, MEMPOOL and SCRIPT_HISTORY are ordered adapter chains
//! ([`ActionChain`]), and UTXO is a capability declared once at startup. The
//! wallet sync engine is a separate explicit axis.
//!
//! Nothing outside slot construction branches on which backend is configured.

	/// A node following the chain by compact block filters over P2P, borrowing
	/// what filters cannot show it from an external fee source and, on a
	/// hybrid node, from a provider, and falling back to what the filters and
	/// the node's own peers can give.
	///
	/// The chains, in order:
	///
	/// A hybrid node runs on its own abilities first: in every slot where the
	/// filter node has an adapter, that adapter leads and the provider is the
	/// fallback, asked only when the node's own adapter cannot answer.
	///
	/// * FEE = [external fee, if configured; coinbase-derived; provider, if
	///   any]. An external fee server is an explicit operator choice and stays
	///   first. The coinbase-derived rates are `Unavailable` while kyoto is not
	///   running — the boot refresh runs before it is launched — and while the
	///   window holds no sample, so the provider answers until the filter node
	///   has a fee market of its own; the background loop retries a failed
	///   refresh on its short recovery cadence. Once samples exist the
	///   after-the-fact rates of recent blocks answer, however thin the window.
	/// * BROADCAST = [P2P; provider, if any]. The node's own peers take the
	///   package. An announced package ends the chain, pulled or not
	///   (`AlreadyKnown` for one no peer asked for); the provider is asked only
	///   when kyoto refused the handoff or is not running. The trade-off: P2P
	///   relay gives no accept/reject verdict, so a transaction the network
	///   refuses is not evicted at once — it is found out late, when the
	///   borrowed mempool view no longer holds it after the own-broadcast grace
	///   window, and only then are its inputs released.
	/// * TX_STATUS = [forward-only watch; provider, if any]. What this node saw
	///   confirm itself outranks what it is told, and costs nothing to ask.
	/// * MEMPOOL = [provider, if any], SCRIPT_HISTORY = [provider, if any]:
	///   nothing a filter node can fill itself.
	/// * UTXO = the existence-only source over the filters when
	///   `cbf_config.utxo_source` asks for it; none otherwise.
	///
	/// `cbf_config.source` picks where headers, filters and blocks come from:
	/// kyoto over P2P, or `filter_source` — required then — with or without
	/// kyoto as its fallback. The P2P broadcast adapter needs kyoto running,
	/// so on a node source it passes to the provider.
	///
	/// `wallet_birthday_height` floors the resume checkpoint here; the builder
	/// seeds a fresh wallet, `ChannelManager` and sweeper at the same anchor.
	/// `fallback` is the provider a hybrid node borrows from, set through
	/// [`crate::Builder::set_chain_provider_fallback`].
