//! The **remote chain provider** port and its wire contract.
//!
//! This is the one public seam a Dependent node is built on. A Dependent node
//! has no chain provider of its own; it asks another node — a Pro node — and
//! believes the answer. The transport is deliberately *not* described here:
//! implementors of [`ChainDataProvider`] own it entirely, which is what keeps
//! this crate free of any knowledge of peers, routes or capabilities.
//!
//! ```text
//!   node-app-ldk-node          ldk-node
//!   ─────────────────          ────────
//!   impl ChainDataProvider  ->  DependentChainAdapter   fills FEE/LOOKUP/BROADCAST,
//!     core.network.send                                 and MEMPOOL/SCRIPT_HISTORY
//!                                                       for a hybrid node
//!                               DependentSyncEngine     fills the sync axis
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the wire types live here
//!
//! BDK's own sync types cannot cross a process boundary: [`SyncRequest`] holds
//! a boxed closure behind private fields, and `TxUpdate` is `#[non_exhaustive]`
//! with no `serde` derives. So the projection has to exist somewhere, and it
//! belongs on the side that owns the semantics — here — rather than being
//! reinvented per transport.
//!
//! Every type below is built from primitives and hex strings only. That is
//! deliberate: it costs a little conversion code and buys a format that does
//! not shift when a dependency enables or disables a `serde` feature, and that
//! stays readable on the wire while we are debugging two nodes against each
//! other.
//!
//! [`SyncRequest`]: bdk_chain::spk_client::SyncRequest
//!
//! # Versioning
//!
//! Every message carries [`CHAIN_WIRE_VERSION`]. A Dependent node must reject a
//! reply it cannot parse rather than half-apply it, because a half-applied
//! wallet update is indistinguishable from a chain reorg. Adapters check this
//! on the way in; see [`ChainProviderError::VersionMismatch`].
