//! Wallet synchronisation engines.
//!
//! The engine is **not** one of the three pluggable abilities. It is a separate,
//! explicit axis, because the backends do not implement one strategy — they
//! implement two structurally incompatible ones:
//!
//! ```text
//!   transaction-based   esplora, electrum
//!                       drives Confirm via lightning-transaction-sync,
//!                       needs Filter::register_tx / register_output
//!
//!   block-polling       bitcoind
//!                       drives Listen via lightning-block-sync, keeps a
//!                       header cache and a cached tip, handles reorgs,
//!                       registers nothing
//! ```
//!
//! Pre-seam both lived in one enum, so each strategy's methods had to exist on
//! the other and panic: four `unreachable!()` arms. Splitting the types removes
//! them by construction — a block-polling engine simply has no
//! `sync_onchain_wallet` to call.
//!
//! Esplora and electrum are both transaction-based but share no code, so this
//! is three implementations, not two.
