//! The filter-driven sync engine: BIP157/158 compact block filters over P2P, via kyoto.
//!
//! A third strategy next to transaction-based and block-polling. Kyoto keeps a header chain
//! from trusted peers and streams every block's filter; the engine matches each filter against
//! the scripts the wallet and LDK watch, fetches only the blocks that match, and drives
//! `Listen` — through the gated [`ChainListener`] — from the [`BlockApplicator`]. Nothing is
//! polled and no server is asked: what this engine cannot see (a mempool, an arbitrary
//! transaction's status, a fee market) it does not pretend to, and the layer's slots borrow it
//! from a provider or an external fee source instead.
//!
//! Ported from DatPham's upstream `CbfChainSource` (`cycles-cbf-828`) onto LDK 0.1 and
//! bdk_wallet 2.x: reorgs are a descending list of headers rather than a `BlockLocator`, the
//! wallet APIs are synchronous, the runtime is the one [`SyncEngine::start`] hands over, and
//! the fee/broadcast hooks became slot adapters.
