//! Chain ability adapters over the filter-driven engine.
//!
//! A CBF node has peers, headers, filters and the blocks it chose to download — and nothing
//! else. Each adapter here fills one slot from exactly that, and says `Unavailable` for
//! everything it cannot see, so the chain moves on to a provider or an external source:
//!
//! * [`CbfDerivedFee`] — FEE from the coinbase of recent blocks. A block's coinbase pays its
//!   subsidy plus every fee it collected, so a window of recent blocks is a fee market seen
//!   after the fact. Coarse, and last in every preset; it is what a node has when nobody
//!   mempool-aware answers.
//! * [`CbfP2pBroadcast`] — BROADCAST straight to the node's own peers over P2P.
//! * [`CbfWatchTxStatus`] — TX_STATUS for a transaction the node was told to watch *before*
//!   it confirmed, answered from the blocks the applicator went through. Forward-only: a
//!   filter node has no history to look back into and never claims one.
//! * [`CbfUtxoSource`] — UTXO verification of channel announcements at the existence-only
//!   level the filters allow, opted into by `CbfConfig::utxo_source`.
//!
//! The fee window, the P2P handoff and its bound are DatPham's (`cycles-cbf-828`), lifted
//! out of the upstream chain source and onto the slots.
