//! The pieces of a BIP157/158 compact-block-filter chain source that are not the engine.
//!
//! Ported from the upstream CBF chain source (DatPham, `cycles-cbf-828`) onto LDK 0.1 and
//! bdk_wallet 2.x, and split along the seam: the sync engine lives in
//! [`crate::chain::engine::cbf`], the block applicator that fans kyoto's output out to the
//! listeners in [`applicator`], the coinbase fee maths in [`fee`], the wallet birthday in
//! [`birthday`]. What is here is shared by more than one of them: the sync state the engine
//! publishes and the applicator advances, the trusted-peer parser, the resume checkpoint
//! derivation, and the [`WatchLedger`] the applicator feeds for the T8 TX_STATUS adapter.
