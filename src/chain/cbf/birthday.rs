//! Wallet birthday resolution for a filter-driven chain source.
//!
//! A fresh CBF wallet has no server to ask "which block was the tip when this wallet was
//! created", and scanning every filter from genesis costs hours on a small device. Instead a
//! configured birthday height is rounded *down* to the nearest checkpoint compiled into the
//! crate, and the wallet, `ChannelManager` and sweeper are seeded there. Rounding down can only
//! extend the scanned range, never shrink it.

/// Returns the highest checkpoint compiled into the `bip157` crate strictly below
/// `first_scan_height`, or `None` when the wallet should root at genesis.
///
/// Strictly below, because everything downstream — the initial BDK checkpoint, the listeners'
/// best block, kyoto's `ChainState::Checkpoint` — treats the anchor as already applied, and
/// scanning begins at the block after it. An anchor *at* `first_scan_height` would silently
/// skip that block's filters, losing a transaction confirmed exactly there.
///
/// Only compiled-in constants are used: CBF has no chain backend at build time, and consulting
/// a third-party tip oracle would reintroduce exactly the dependency this chain source removes.
/// Mainnet ships three such anchors — 481,823 (one block before SegWit activation), 709,631 (one
/// block before taproot activation) and 965,999 (see [`anchor_965_999`]); all other networks
/// resolve to `None`.
