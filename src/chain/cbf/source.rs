//! The **filter source** port: where a compact-block-filter node gets raw
//! BIP157/158 consensus data from.
//!
//! This is kept apart from [`ChainDataProvider`] on purpose. A
//! `ChainDataProvider` hands back *indexed answers* — "this transaction is
//! confirmed", "here is your wallet update" — that the asking node has no way
//! to check and must trust. A `FilterSource` hands back *raw consensus data*
//! — headers, filter headers, filters, blocks — that the consuming CBF engine
//! verifies itself: proof of work, the filter-header chain, the merkle root.
//! A lying source cannot make a verifying client accept a header, a chain or
//! a block that is not valid. It can withhold data — including, since nothing
//! in a header commits to a filter, leaving a transaction out of a filter
//! that is consistent with its own filter-header chain. A client with a
//! single source trusts it for inclusion; see
//! `CbfSource::trusts_source_for_inclusion` (with the `cbf` feature).
//!
//! One trait, several implementations (a symmetric port):
//!
//! ```text
//!   BitcoindRpcSource   a Pro node reads its own bitcoind      (this crate)
//!   NodeFilterSource    a hybrid node asks a Pro node over the  (the embedding app)
//!                       Node network, which answers through
//!                       Node::chain_serve_headers & co.
//!   kyoto               the Bitcoin P2P network                 (the `cbf` feature)
//! ```
//!
//! The module is compiled without the `cbf` feature: a Pro node serves raw
//! data from its RPC source without following the chain by filters itself.
//!
//! The wire conversions an app needs to implement a network-backed source are
//! re-exported here, next to the trait they serve.
//!

///   raced a reorg and should re-read the tip.
/// * **Bounded.** A serving implementation may refuse spans larger than
///   [`MAX_HEADERS_PER_REQUEST`], [`MAX_FILTER_HEADERS_PER_REQUEST`] or
///   [`MAX_FILTERS_PER_REQUEST`]; callers page.
/// * **Prefixes.** [`FilterSource::filter_headers`] and
///   [`FilterSource::filters`] may answer a non-empty *prefix* of the span —
///   the first blocks of it, from `start_height` — when the whole would be
///   too large for one reply; callers continue from where it ended. An empty
///   answer is invalid.
/// * **Errors are cheap; silence is not.** Implementations apply their own
///   timeouts.
/// * **Idempotent.** Every call may be retried.
