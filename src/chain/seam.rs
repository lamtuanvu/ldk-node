//! The pluggable chain abilities.
//!
//! Each ability is one slot on [`crate::chain::ChainLayer`]. A slot is an
//! **ordered chain of adapters** — an [`ActionChain`] — not a single adapter.
//! A node functions identically whichever adapters occupy a slot, and no code
//! outside slot construction branches on which ones they are.
//!
//! # The per-action slots
//!
//! | Slot             | Trait                   | Default budget           |
//! |------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
//! | FEE              | [`FeeAction`]           | [`FEE_BUDGET`]           |
//! | BROADCAST        | [`BroadcastAction`]     | [`BROADCAST_BUDGET`]     |
//! | TX_STATUS        | `TxStatusAction`        | [`TX_STATUS_BUDGET`]     |
//! | MEMPOOL          | [`MempoolAction`]       | [`MEMPOOL_BUDGET`]       |
//! | SCRIPT_HISTORY   | [`ScriptHistoryAction`] | [`SCRIPT_HISTORY_BUDGET`]|
//! | UTXO             | [`UtxoCapability`]      | — (not an action)        |
//!
//! The slot default applies to an adapter that declares no budget of its own
//! (`budget() == None`). An adapter whose backend already bounds itself
//! declares a budget sitting just above that bound, so its own timeout fires
//! first and the error it logs is the one an operator sees.
//!
//! Headers, blocks and filter matches are deliberately **not** slots: their
//! only consumers are a `Listen`-driven sync engine and its `UtxoSource`, and a
//! block fetched from a different adapter than the headers came from would fail
//! reorg consistency anyway. They stay engine-internal.
//!
//! # Error taxonomy
//!
//! Every action answers with an [`ActionResult`], whose error is
//! [`ChainActionError`]:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Unavailable   the adapter could not answer
//!                 -> the chain advances to the next adapter
//!                    timeout and transport failure both map here
//!
//!   Rejected      the adapter answered, and the answer is NO
//!                 -> terminal; the chain does NOT advance
//!                    a tx the network refuses is refused by every adapter
//!
//!   Ok            answer accepted; the chain stops here
//! ```
//!
//! The split is load-bearing. A Dependent node must be able to tell "nobody
//! could answer" from "I was told no": conflating the two is how a node treats
//! an unreachable provider as evidence that a transaction was refused, or —
//! worse — keeps trying the next adapter with a transaction the network has
//! already rejected.
//!
//! # Rules the combinator enforces
//!
//! * **Every call runs under a budget the seam enforces.** [`ActionChain`]
//!   wraps each adapter call in [`tokio::time::timeout`] — the adapter's
//!   declared budget, else the slot default — and an adapter that overruns it
//!   is `Unavailable` with `timed_out` set. An adapter may say how long it
//!   legitimately takes; it may not run unbounded.
//! * **Exhaustion is an honest failure.** When no adapter answers, the slot
//!   fails with `Unavailable`. The seam never fabricates an answer and never
//!   serves a stale value a caller would act on.
//! * **A chain of length one is legal.** That is how "no fallback" is spelled.
//!   An empty chain is legal to construct and always `Unavailable`.
//!
//! Every action slot runs on a chain. SCRIPT_HISTORY is empty in every
//! preset today: the adapter that can fill it exists, and the presets that
//! will are the hybrid ones.
//!
//! # MEMPOOL answers in one of two scopes
//!
//! A poll loop wants only what changed since the last answer, because its
//! asker keeps everything it was told and re-applying a whole mempool every
//! tick is pure cost. A question asked on behalf of another node wants
//! everything relevant, because nothing is remembered about that node. The
//! [`MempoolQuery`] says which ([`MempoolScope`]); an adapter that keeps no
//! per-asker memory answers everything either way, which is also correct.
//!
//! # BROADCAST is package-shaped
//!
//! The queue hands the slot every transaction LDK asked to broadcast together
//! (a commitment tx and its anchor CPFP, say), and the adapter answers for the
//! package, transaction by transaction. Each backend still sends one
//! transaction at a time and keeps its own error classification and log
//! levels; it folds each send into a [`TxBroadcastOutcome`] and hands the
//! package's worth of those — the [`PackageOutcomes`] — back to the chain,
//! where [`package_result`] turns them into the slot's answer. `Ok` means every
//! transaction was handed to the network — accepted, or already known to it.
//! `Rejected` lists the transactions the network refused, and the layer's
//! shared tail evicts them from the on-chain wallet so their inputs are
//! spendable again. The per-transaction outcomes outlive the verdict: when a
//! package was partly accepted and the chain then ran out of adapters, the
//! tail still knows which transactions are on the network.
