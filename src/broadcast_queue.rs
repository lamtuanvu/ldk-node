//! Per-transaction broadcast policies, and the queue of transactions held for a rebroadcast.
//!
//! LDK's [`BroadcasterInterface`] carries no metadata, and LDK hands each channel funding to it
//! on its own, whenever that channel's peer answers `funding_signed`. Two opens funded from one
//! coin therefore race: the second funding spends the change of the first, and when the second
//! peer answers first the child reaches the network before its parent and is refused with
//! `bad-txns-inputs-missingorspent`. LDK never broadcasts a funding again, so before this module
//! that refusal left the channel waiting for confirmations forever.
//!
//! Whoever builds a transaction says what should happen to it, by txid, before it is broadcast:
//! [`BroadcastPolicy::QueueUntilParents`] — the default for every transaction this node's
//! on-chain wallet builds — or [`BroadcastPolicy::DropOnReject`], the behaviour every other
//! transaction (LDK's own claims and commitments, which LDK rebroadcasts itself) keeps. The
//! BROADCAST tail of the chain layer looks the policy up:
//!
//! * a queued transaction the network refuses because an input is missing, or that no backend
//!   could be asked about, is **held**: its inputs stay reserved in the on-chain wallet, and it
//!   is sent again as soon as a parent is broadcast or confirms, and otherwise on a bounded
//!   backoff;
//! * it is **given up** — its inputs released exactly as a refused transaction's always were —
//!   only on a definitive answer: an input spent by a different confirmed transaction, a parent
//!   this node gave up on, a refusal for any reason other than a missing input, or its
//!   `max_age` passing.
//!
//! The given-up transactions are remembered for a while, so the dead-funding reaper can close a
//! channel whose funding, or one of its parents, this node gave up on
//! ([`crate::dead_funding`]). Everything here is persisted on every change: a node that
//! restarts keeps holding, and keeps retrying, what it held.
